# SDS510 Final Project
<p>In my Data Wrangling course, we were tasked to apply the techniques and libraries we learned about throughout the course 
to a data analysis project of our own.</p>
<p>For my project, I looked into the relationship between EVs and Combustion engines to the Air quality recorded in states. To accompliosh this, 
  I utilized Pandas/Numpy to run analysis, Dash to create graphics for representing my findings, and BeautifulSoup to web scrape when data wasn't 
  available for download</p>
